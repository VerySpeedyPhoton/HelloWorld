This is my amazing first push on the GitHub.

Any comments are welcome, you can request a pull request by:
    1. click the fork on the Github repo
    2. copy the repo URL under your account
    3. `git clone <URL
    4. `cd <directory>`
    5. `git remote -v` check the remote 
    6. `git remote add upstream <URL of the centralized repo>` add the remote of the centralized repo
    7. `git checkout -b <new branch name>`
    8. change/edit files you want
    9. `git add <file>`
    10. `git commit -m 'xxxxxx'`
        * `git commit -amend` fix your commit message
    11. `git push origin <branch name>` push to the origin (under your own account)
    12. then if you go to the centralized repo, you can see the changes of the fork, and you can ask for pull request with the title and description.
